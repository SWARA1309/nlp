# News Title Generator
Headline generation is within the category of the text summarization. In this project, we would like to modify the current way of headline generation and automatically generate headlines from the text of news articles. Since headlines are terse and convey the most important theme of the input text, it wonâ€™t be appropriate to just select a subset of actual sentences from the original text as a summary. Instead, it should be generated by building the semantic representation of the text to create a summary.
